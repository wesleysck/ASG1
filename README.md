Purpose: Website for fictional company 'Slices Pizza' allowing customers to preview their products through an online menu, learn more about the company through an About Us page, and find store locations through a location page.

Goal: To attract more customers to dine in by allowing them to locate outlets easier and preview the menu first, through a easily navigatable website.

## Design Process

This website is meant mainly for people who want to know more about 'Slices pizza'. Usually when someone hears about a good food place, they probably ask where they can find it, Which is why a location page was implemented for them to locate the different stores around Singapore. In the page is a menu with the different stores, times they are open until, with a map to show the location better beside. This makes it much easier for users to know the exact locations of the outets and when they can come to enjoy a meal. Before they come though, they can preview the menu. This allows them to have the option to make a decision on what they want to try in advance, saving their time when they actually get there. The about us page allows them to get to know the company better and its history, and put a face to the brand, through the image of the company owner. This allows them to better appreciate how far the company has come from when it first started.
