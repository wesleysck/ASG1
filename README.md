Purpose: Website for fictional company 'Slices Pizza' allowing customers to preview their products through an online menu, learn more about the company through an About Us page, and find store locations through a location page.

Goal: To attract more customers to dine in by allowing them to locate outlets easier and preview the menu first, through a easily navigatable website.

## Design Process

This website is meant mainly for people who want to know more about 'Slices pizza'.

As a user, when I hear about a good food place, I will probably ask where I can find the outlets, Which is why a location page would help me.

As a user, I want clear details on where and when I can visit the outlets, which is why in location the page is a menu with the different stores, times they are open until, and a map to show the location better beside.

As a user, I may want to preview the menu before going to the store, hence the products page allows me to have the option to make a decision on what I want to try in advance, saving time when I actually get there.

As a user, I may want to get to know the company and its history better, and puts a face to the brand. This allows me to better appreciate how far the company has come from when it first started.

As a user, I sometimes do not know if the website is responding to my actions, hence hover effects and and backgrounds responding to cursor movements help me with that.
